# Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe

**Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe** is a modern twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, incorporating principles of quantum mechanics to introduce new strategic dimensions. Players engage in a game where each move involves quantum superposition and entanglement, creating a dynamic and intellectually stimulating experience.

## Gameplay Instructions

Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe introduces new mechanics into the classic game:

1. **Game Start**
    - Player X begins with a **Classical Move**.

2. **Classical Move**
    - **Action**: Collapse a quantum state into either 'X' or 'O' with equal probability.
    - **Result**: The selected cell changes from a quantum state (superposition of X and O) to a classical state (either X or O).

3. **Quantum Move**
    - **Action**: Entangle a control box (quantum state) with a target box (classical state).
    - **Strategy**: If the control box collapses to the player's favored state during a Classical Move, the target box state inverses (e.g., X becomes O, and vice versa).
    - **Effect**: Creates dependencies that influence the game's progression, adding strategic depth.

4. **Winning Condition**
    - Align three of your marks ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.

5. **Draw**
    - If all cells are in classical states without any player achieving the winning condition, the game ends in a draw.
